CSC309 - Project Proposal
=========================

Application Description
-----------------------

TODO - A paragraph or two describing the topic of your application. What is the
overall purpose of your application? Who does it serve? Explain at a high level
what users will be able to do using your application.

User Interactions
-----------------

TODO - A detailed list of the user interactions with the application. How will
you get data into your application? What are all the different things a user
will do when they use your application?

Sketches
--------

TODO - Sketches of what the views will look like to the user. These do not have
to be fancy polished drawings, or HTML mockups. They must be legible, but they
could be scanned hand drawings.
